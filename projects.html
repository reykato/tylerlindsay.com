                            <p class="description">
                                In late September 2022, I had an idea for the ultimate Christmas gift to my partner - a messaging system between us which
                                allows us to leave each other short notes for when we get back home. After about 40 hours of learning, coding,
                                troubleshooting, soldering, and updating, I have created its most current version. (Yes, it was worth it.) Hosted on a remote webserver,
                                the secure web client provides a text box and buttons to submit messages and photos (photo display functionality not yet finished).
                                Once one of the buttons are pressed, the text in the box is saved to a file using PHP, and a list file is updated with its
                                filename.
                                <br>
                                <br>The message receiver (codenamed The Dingus) is a Lilygo T-Display-S3 microcontroller using the ESP32-S3 SoC. Using periodic
                                HTTP file get requests, the dingus can grab the list of filenames from the server and determine which messages are new. If a
                                new message is found, the user can use the built-in buttons (soldered to device with perfboard) to display and navigate the
                                new messages and previous messages.

                                As a student in university, I meet new people very often. To help learn more about me and get to know me in further
                                detail, I built my own digital portfolio. The computer-science-student part of me decided it would be built from scratch,
                                resulting in many nightmares about CSS and front-end design. I am proud of learning enough to make
                                this portfolio usable! Through updating this site, I continually find better ways to code websites and create more
                                friendly layouts.

                                This site is hosted using HostGator and runs Apache with cPanel for server management.

                                During the height of the COVID pandemic, I had a lot of free time to spend around the house. One thing I enjoyed doing 
                                was socializing and interacting with others in a game called VRChat. Many users in the game have custom avatars - ones 
                                that reflect how they want to look, also offering an artistic outlet for self-expression. I did the only logical thing, which 
                                was to spend weeks learning to use Unity and upload avatars using the VRChat SDK.
                                <br>
                                <br>Using a model called the "Rexouium" made by a 3D artist by the name of Rezillo Ryker, I had a blank slate to work with. Adobe Substance 3D 
                                was my software of choice for painting the model and learning all about Physically Based Rendering (PBR) textures. Opening Unity, 
                                there were still many more things I needed to learn about: shaders, visemes, blendshapes, and more - just to modify the model and 
                                put my custom textures on. After doing so, I also wanted to add finishing touches: animating some shader options and implementing an in-game menu for 
                                the ability to change the color of my avatar while playing. This project took me about 25 hours total, and I am currently working on a new one!
                                <br>
                                <br>Here's a showcase video which I made as part of a class in my sophomore year:
